# Games Collection Package

## Sources

In this package, we will select some popular games from other packages,

[fun package](https://github.com/yihui/fun)...

in which the codes are poorly commented and contain some bugs. Moreover, the coding style and coding

strategy are somehow "out-of-fashion" because they were created a couple of years ago.

## Purpose

We aim to renew some of the games by:

(1)Adding comments to the codes so that they are easy to understand;

(2)Fixing the bugs and make some modifications to the codes;

(3)Adding some factors to the games so that they are more "playable". For example, add a restart 

button so that we don't have to call the function over and over again.

## Functions

(1)A function that returns a table that contains the names of the games and their following profile;

(2)Mine sweeper function (modified);

(3)Snake function (modified);

(4)Gomoku function (modified);

(5)(Possible)Tag cloud function (modified);

## More

The modified games will be included in the Shiny App project.
