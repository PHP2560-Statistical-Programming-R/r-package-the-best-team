# Games Collection Package

## Sources

In this package, we will select some popular games from other packages,

[fun package](https://github.com/yihui/fun)...

in which the codes are poorly commented and contain some bugs. Moreover, the coding style and coding

strategy are somehow "out-of-fashion" because they were created a couple of years ago.

## Purpose

We aim to renew some of the games by:

(1)Adding comments to the codes so that they are easy to understand;

(2)Fixing the bugs and make some modifications to the codes;

(3)Adding some factors to the games so that they are more "playable". For example, add a restart 

button so that we don't have to call the function over and over again.

## Functions

(1)A function that returns a table that contains the names of the games and their following profile;

(2)Mine sweeper function (modified); You can just type in start() to start the game. left click is to identify the mines. Right click is for the flags. You will have the options for restart if the game ends. I won't tell you there's bonus scene that you can cheat in the program! hahaha glhf!

(3)Snake function (modified);

(4)Gomoku function (modified);

(5)(Possible)Tag cloud function (modified);

## More

The modified games will be included in the Shiny App project.
