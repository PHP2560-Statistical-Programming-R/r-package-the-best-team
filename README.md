# r-package-the-best-team
The package we design is to turn the boring R platform into a gaming platform. 
This package named as Brown64in1, from the old school nintendo video game compliation. (64in1 was taken by others)
The package consist several small games for entertainment, including mine sweeper, gomoku, sodoku and so on. 
Some of the games in the package are fetched from others design. Some might need some work to finish by ourselves. 
And we will create a list in order to show all the games included.
