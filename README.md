## Plan 1: Games Collection Package
This package we would like to design is to turn the boring R platform into a gaming platform. 
This package named as Brown64in1, from the old school nintendo video game compliation. (64in1 was taken by others)
The package consist several small games for entertainment, including mine sweeper, gomoku, sodoku and so on. 
Some of the games in the package are fetched from others design. Others might need some work to get finished by ourselves. 
And we will create a list in order to show all the games included. 

## Plan 2: Music Analysis Package
This package we would like to design is to explore musical data amd do some sound analysis with R. 
Use the method we learned in the text mining project to visualize the musical data.
