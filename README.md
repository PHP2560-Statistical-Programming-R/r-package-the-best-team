# Games Collection Package

## Sources

In this package, we will select some popular games from other packages,

[fun package](https://github.com/yihui/fun)...

in which the codes are poorly commented and contain some bugs. Moreover, the coding style and coding

strategy are somehow "out-of-fashion" because they were created a couple of years ago.

## Purpose

We aim to renew some of the games by:

(1)Add comments to the codes so that they are easy to understand;

(2)Fix the bugs and make some modifications to the codes;

(3)Add some factors to the games so that they are more "playable".

## Functions

(1)A function that returns a table that contains the names of the games their following profile;

(2)Mine sweeper function (modified);

(3)Tag cloud function (modified);

(4)Gomoku function (modified):

(5)Maybe add some more depending on the progress...

## More

The modified games will be included in the Shiny App project.
